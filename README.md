# SpitgotPluginTest
This is a first test plugin for Spigot. Please be aware this is for self-educational purposes.
I'm not entirely sure on the content that this plugin will contain but for the time being it is for the purpose of becoming better associated with the Spigot API and programming in Minecraft.
